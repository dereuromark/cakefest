<h2>CakeFest 2014 - Who is on board?</h2>
<p><b>August 21st - August 24th</b>, Madrid, Spain</p>

<h3>What is the CakeFest</h3>
<p>
It's the <a href="http://cakefest.org/" target="_blank">annual conference dedicated to CakePHP</a>.
<br />
Join us now at the awesome meetup of most CakePHP devs.
</p>

<h3>What is this site for</h3>
<p>
We hear it all the time in the IRC channel: "Are you going to the fest?" etc.
<br />
Currently, it is difficult to know from all devs who will be at the conference, and from when to when.
This page helps to set a basic attendance overview. Also, if you allow other people to see your email or provide an IRC nick, you
might be able to connect before, after and especially during the event to socialize, hang out or party :-)
