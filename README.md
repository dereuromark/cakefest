## Installation

### Auto-installation using Cakebox and Vagrant
This works for all OS.

Install your [CakeBox](https://github.com/alt3/cakebox) and create a fresh app using `cakebox application add cakefest.local`.
* Add the `/etc/hosts` entry as outlined.

Then vagrant ssh into it and
* Go to the `/Apps/` dir and replace it with the actual cakefest repo by moving it to some `cakebox.backup` it and `git clone git@github.com:dereuromark/cakefest.git cakefest.local`
* Go into `/Apps/cakefest.local/` dir
* Create a `/config/app_local.php/` config file with database credentials from CakeBox (you can use the `app_local.default.php` template and the generated "cakebox.backup config file").
* Make sure you are in `/Apps/cakefest.local/` again when running `sh setup` to install dependencies, DB and CO.
* Check it out at `http://cakefest.local`.
* Create an admin account to login in using `bin/cake Setup.user create admin`
* Log in and create an event
* Now the homepage should display something

### Manual installation

* Clone this repo via git - or download it manually.
* Navigate into the ROOT folder.
* Run composer install/update on it (this will also install CakePHP into the vendor folder and all plugins).
* Create a `/config/app_local.php/` config file with database credentials (you can use the `app_local.default.php` template).
* Create a vhost with a local dev domain of your choice, e.g. `cakefest.local`, and use ROOT/webroot/ as document root.
* Check it out at `http://cakefest.local`.
* See other steps above for more
